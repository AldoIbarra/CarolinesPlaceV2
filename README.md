# React + Vite

These are the steps to get the project working, you'll need to have Git bash installed and nodeJs v20.11.1 LTS

1.- Get the project by doing a 'git clone' or dowloading it

2.- In the main folder of the project, which is 'CarolinesPlace', open a CMD and run 'npm i', it'll install the tools needed to run the enviroment

3.- Then, in the same folder, excecute 'npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap' to install Bootstrap

4.- And 'npm install react-router-dom --save' to install the Router

5.- Now go to the BackEnd folder, open another cmd and run 'npm i Express' to install Express

6.- And 'node + [NAME OF THE BACK END FILE]', which in this case is 'Expressito.js'

7.- Without closing the backend CMD (actually, always keep it running), open another CMD in the main folder and run 'npm run dev' 

8.- Open the localhost that the server started running and that's it.

9.- At the end, you'll have 3 open cmd's 

    I.- The first one on the main folder where you ran all those 'npm i' commands, you can close that.
    
    II.- The second where you ran Express in the backend folder, you have to keep that running, so minimize it but don't close it.
    
    III.- The third one where you ran 'npm run dev', you need to keep that open too so minimize it but dont close it.
